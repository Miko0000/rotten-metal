			<h2>History</h2>
			<p>
	Dreameater, a pitch black mass seeking to devour whatever's within it's
grasp. It's presence dates back from before the mythical age, when supposedly
a cosmic tear leaks a pitch black liquid that landed on the {{rename|Yalmo'ord}}
mountain range.
			</p>
			<div>
				<p>
	When one's body perishes, the rest of them left their body to fulfill
it's promise to the world. After that, a new body is created to hold their
mind, without their past memories except a little and what they're willing to
afford, in the form of dreams and reminiscence.
				</p>
				<p>
	They keep going, one body after another, bringing their dreams with
them as a companion for their journey through what appears to be eternity, and
eternity it seems.
				</p>
				<p>
	Until they fell prey to the black mass that devours everything. Their
body is devoured, trapped in a dark place with seemingly no escape, alongside
their mind. It cannot escape the pitch black walls that surrounds it, 
forever become one with the ever-growing mass.
				</p>
				<p>
	That's where their journey ends, their mind, their body, their dreams.
Devoured by a Dreameater.
